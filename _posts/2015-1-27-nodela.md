It's amazing how big a difference an interface can make. I made one for the Roland-Modela, a discontinued micro-milling machine, and I now find it to be a far more useful tool for milling PCBs.

##Starting With the Modela

I like to make my own microcontrollers, like the <a href="http://arduino.cc" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">Arduino</a>. It's components come cheap (the processor is $3, the rest are pennies), and luckily I work as a researcher at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">ITP</a>, which has acquired a fleet of machines this past year for assembling PCBs.

A year ago, the process of making PCBs was a bit of a nightmare, especially for a student and beginner. One tutorial that got me started was <a href="http://fablab.marcboon.com/pcb/" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">this one</a>, by Marc Boon from 7 years ago. It works. But executing a job is slow, unintuitive, and hard to teach students on top of everything else they need to learn that semester.

Toolpath lines are drawn as using <code>WIRE</code> commands in Eagle. The ULP found in the tutorial above will auto-generate these lines on Layer 46 in Eagle. However, the algorithm isn't that great, and you'll need to spend time editing the placement of these lines. Personally, I've found I get better results and faster turn arounds drawing toolpath lines by hand using <code>WIRE</code>.

However, toolpath lines are not the biggest problem. The machine is difficult to interact with. There is no graphical interface for newcomers to learn through. There is no way to jog the bit around and decide where you're cut's origin will be. There is no way to erase the Modela's internal memory other than running some bash scripts and crossing your fingers. There is no fixture or indentation to align your board and prevent skewing it. There is no way to interact with the machine without relying heavily on the command prompt.

For all these reasons, and to help teach about 15 beginner students each semester the process, I decided to make a graphical interface interface.

##Installing and Running Nodela

Be sure you have installed NodeJS and the Roland drivers onto the Windows machine, as well as comfirmed you have a serial connection with the Modela. Sadly, the Modela has a very small serial buffer, and the only known way to communicate with it is with Roland's proprietary drivers installed on Windows. This means Nodela must be run on Windows.

The current version can be found on <a href="https://github.com/andySigler/nodela" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">GitHub</a>. Download the repo, <code>cd</code> into the folder, and run <code>npm install</code> to install the required node modules.

Once done, run <code>node nodela.js</code>. The command prompt should automatically open your default browser to the correct address, and you will be prompted to drag your <code>.brd</code> file onto the screen.

##Preparing Your Eagle File

Toolpath lines are still designed in Eagle. These lines are still <code>WIRE</code> commands, and can be generated using the linked ULP or drawn by hand (my preference).

An Eagle .brd design file is dragged into the interface, and the browser will parse your file, searching for three components:
<ol><li><code>WIREs</code></li>
<li><code>HOLEs</code></li>
<li><code>VIAs</code></li></ol>

###Milling with Wires

<code>WIREs</code> are used to tell the Modela to cut along a line. These lines can cut shallowly (to create routes), or cut through the board (to create the board's dimension).

For each sized end mill you plan to use (1/32", 1/64", or 1/100"), create a new Layer in Eagle and draw <code>WIREs</code> for where that bit will go. Different Layers are needed, because Nodela will treat each Layer in Eagle as a separate job to run. This means we can change bits between running Layers.

###Drilling the Holes and Vias

Both <code>HOLEs</code> and <code>VIAs</code> are assigned single points, and the Modela will drill straight down into them. This means the diameter of the bit you use will determine the diameter of these drill spots.
