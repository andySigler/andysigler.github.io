##Making Hardware is Hard

It's amazing how big a difference an interface can make. I made one for the Roland-Modela, a discontinued micro-milling machine, and I now find it to be a far more useful tool for milling PCBs.

The current version can be found on <a href="https://github.com/andySigler/nodela" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">GitHub</a>. Sadly, the Modela has a very small serial buffer, and the only known way to communicate with it is with Roland's proprietary drivers installed on Windows. This means nodela must be run on Windows.

##Starting With the Modela

I like to make my own microcontrollers, like the <a href="http://arduino.cc" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">Arduino</a>. It's components come cheap (the processor is $3, the rest are pennies), and luckily I work as a researcher at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">ITP</a>, which has acquired a fleet of machines this past year for assembling PCBs.

A year ago, the process of making PCBs was a bit of a nightmare, especially for a student and beginner. One tutorial that got me started was <a href="http://fablab.marcboon.com/pcb/" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">this one</a>, by Marc Boon from 7 years ago. It works. But executing a job is slow, unintuitive, and hard to teach students on top of everything else they need to learn that semester.
