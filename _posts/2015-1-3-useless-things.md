##Why "Useless" Things?

Current trends in connected devices and fabrication methods have brought me to a new design process I like to call "Useless". It combines the principles of physical computing, interoperability, and decentralized manufacturing.

To take control of the things around us, we must change why and how we make them. The point is to create a diverse ecosystem of connected things; an ecosystem realized through Maker practices and principles, not venture capitalists.

<div class="message">
While I use the term "Useless" to explain the concept, it is not totally accurate. "Useless" things can turn out to be very useful. However, I feel the choice of word helps to make my point.

##Consumer Data is Useful

The Internet of Things is here, and companies have found a new use for selling their gizmos: gathering consumer data. Connected trackers promise to be the new incarnation of self-help, but their real use is in piping your data to their makers.

Data ownership is being abused before it is even publicly understood. A couple of new products that terrify me:

* <a href="http://www.amazon.com/oc/echo" class="inpost-link" target="_blank">Amazon's Echo</a> is a device who's sole purpose is to perform 24/7 speech analysis for Amazon, right in the comfort of your own home.
* <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/830527119/point-a-softer-take-on-home-security" class="inpost-link" target="_blank">Form's Point</a> is a WiFi connected sensor box, to detect smoke, light, and sound. All data is sent straight to their servers for analysis.

##What are "Useless" Things?

"Useless" here has a few meanings.

First, a "Useless" thing is of less use to a company, because it does not consume user data. A connected device that does not feed data back to its maker is less interesting to shareholders.

Second, it is "Useless" in that it does not satisfy a specific need or purpose. A "Useless" thing is interoperable with other connected devices, and can therefore can be repurposed through changing its connections.

Given these two pillars, one could say the <a href="http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/" class="inpost-link" target="_blank">Philips Hue Light</a> is a "Useless" thing. It works on your local network, and doesn't share data with Philips. It's also interoperable with modern phones, laptops, and other connected things, so users can invent their own applications for using Hue.

##Diversity Through Open Source

However, the Philips Hue Light is not open source, and is therefore not easy to iterate upon. Anyone can participate and iterate on a product when the market uses open source.

A wide variety of products are made accessible to a market when the means of manufacturing are coupled with decentralized iteration and innovation. If the Hue Light were open source, the home lighting market could potentially experience hightened innovation and variety.

However, open source is not useful to Philips. Companies want to receive full compensation for their research and development. Releasing a product through open source means would certainly mean less short-term gains.

<div class="message">
In China, the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanzhai" target="_blank" class="inpost-link">shanzhai</a> is used to describe the process of taking a product or brand, and iterating upon its design to gain an advantage in the local markets. Cities like Shenzhen are experiencing great innovation because of this culture. Staying ahead means simply being better than the competition. It does not mean holding valuable intellectual property at ransom.

##Decentralized Manufacturing

Therefore, a "Useless" thing is open source, to allow for greater diversity through decentralized iteration and development.

This iteration must be able to be accomplished by those that do not have access to the means of mass-production. The literal translation of shenzhai is "mountain stronghold," which refers to having acess to a factory for practicing shenzhai.
