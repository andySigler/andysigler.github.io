[Updated July 11, 2019]

Beginning to absorb machine learning, and how I might apply it towards my interests, has been a daunting task these past few weeks. Even with all the hype, tensorflow has what feels like no (zero) good examples, tutorials, guides.

This is a list of the things I've used to understand machine learning concepts, tensorflow basics, and building a model.

[Note] these are ordered psuedo-chronologically, the idea being I wish I started at the first one, and ended with the last one.

### [Make Your Own Neural Network](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Your-Own-Neural-Network-ebook/dp/B01EER4Z4G)

Great (short) book by Tariq Rashid, guides the reader through writing a simple deep network from scratch in python.

### [Machine Learning for Artists](https://ml4a.github.io/ml4a/)

Website and courses by Gene Kogan, and understanding neural networks from the non-engineering, creative perspective. The lecture are great to just sit back and watch, try to absorb before moving on to actually making anything.

### [MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)

This short course was taught January 2019 to MIT students, and is a great intro and overview of what machine learning and tensorflow can offer. There are just a few lectures, and some homework that goes with them.

### [Tensoflow Tutorials from GitHub user aymericdamien](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples)

These tutorials have the most stars on github, the I love them because they don't have distracting dependencies. These tutorials also include both lower-level learning, plus later examples that use Keras layer.

### [Tensorflow v2 Alpha Tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha)

The offical tutorials. These are good for getting a deeper explaination from the developers. However, the tutorials have a lot of distracting dependencies, and the explainations tend to say a lot yet say very little...

### [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

I read that this was considered the "bible" of machine learning. I found that while it can be fairly dense with mathematics, there are some invaluable bottom-line summaries, suggestions, and best-practices riddled throughout this book.

### [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/)

Coming from designing electro-mechanical and wireless systems, I know how the development, test, and debug approach is very import. This reading gives what seems like great advice for how to approach buidling a model, step-by-step, to help catch mistakes when they happen.
