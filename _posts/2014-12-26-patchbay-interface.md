The Patchbay the graphical interface was developed for my 2014 master's thesis at ITP. It was designed to greatly simplify multi-device interactions, and allows users to make and break links between wireless objects.

A working demo of the Patchbay can be found here, along with documentation from my Thesis Day presentation. To use the Patchbay, check out the Github Repo and the RFm12b radio.
