I spent about a year working as a Electronics Design Engineer at [Tomorrow Lab](https://www.tomorrow-lab.com).

Below I have described three products that I contributed to, some with more contributions than others. Other products that we spent considerable time on and were never revealed to the world (for a number of reasons), those are not shown on this page.

### WayCount - Traffic Counter

[See documentation on Tomorrow Lab's website](https://www.tomorrow-lab.com/work/waycount)

The WayCount it a car-counting device. It uses long tubes stretched across a rode to sense a car, logs the time it happened, and then transfers the accumulated data over Bluetooth to the owner's smartphone.

My contributions to this project were:

 - Early component testing and selection
 - Systems design
 - Firmware development
 - Electrical/PCB design
 - Testing

### Lotik - Water Monitor

[See documentation on Tomorrow Lab's website](https://www.tomorrow-lab.com/work/lotik)

This device, designed for [Lotik Labs](https://lotik.com), is a water-usage monitor of for residential plumbing. The device is clamped onto any water pipe, like for a sink, faucet, or toilet, and it can detect when and how much water is flowing. This data is then sent wireless to a central hub located in the building, to transmit to Lotik's central monitoring service.

### Rally - Phone Charger

[See documentation on Tomorrow Lab's website](https://www.tomorrow-lab.com/work/rally)

The Rally Charging Cable was designed for [Rally](https://rallycharge.com/), to a simple iPhone charging cable for public use. Any user, whether at a restaurant, bar, or other public space, can simply connect their phone to get a quick charge. When connected, the device charges the iPhone like normal, except the iPhone will display advertisements while being charged. Once the user is done charging, simply unplug and the advertisements stop.

My contributions to this project were minimal, as it was finishing up when I first joined Tomorrow Lab. I contributed to final PCB design and testing for the integrated iPhone cable.
