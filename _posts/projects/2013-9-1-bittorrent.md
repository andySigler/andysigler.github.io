A collection of small frontend projects and animations made during my summer 2013 internship in the BitTorrent marketing department.

## 404 Page

[![BitTorrent 404 Page]({{site.url}}/images/bittorrent-404-page.png)](http://andysigler.github.io/bittorrent-404/)

A concept for the BitTorrent 404 page, where it looks like everything is breaking and glitching.

Once it breaks, you can pick-up and throw around pieces of the webpage that had fallen.

[Try it out here](http://andysigler.github.io/bittorrent-404/)

## uTorrent Animation

A realtime animation of the (old) uTorrent brand image.

## Browser Sticker

[![Browser Sticker]({{site.url}}/images/bookmarklet_small.png)]({{site.url}}/projects/browser-tag/)

A fun project, where you can inject a "BitTorrent Is Not a Crime" sticker onto any webpage. It's, like, tagging spaces on the internet (get it?).

## BitTorrent Live: Simulation

[![BitTorrent Live Simulation]({{site.url}}/images/bittorrent-live-simulation.png)](http://andysigler.github.io/bittorent-live-simulation/)

At the time in 2013, BitTorrent had just released it's live streaming protocol, BitTorrent Live. I decided to learn about how the protocol itself worked, and create a realtime simulation in the browser to demonstrate how it works.

Video frames (from the center of the screen) are shared with many "nodes", and the small circles flying around the screen represent individual packets moving across the internet.

## BitTorrent Sync: Simulation

[![BitTorrent Sync Simulation]({{site.url}}/images/bittorrent-sync-simulation.png)](http://andysigler.github.io/bittorent-sync-simulation/)

At the time in 2013, BitTorrent had recently released it's file sharing system, BitTorrent Sync. I decided to learn about how the protocol itself worked, and create a realtime simulation in the browser to demonstrate how it works.

The idea is that there are 4 images shared across different BitTorrent Sync users. Draw on one of the images, and all the other ones will be updated.
