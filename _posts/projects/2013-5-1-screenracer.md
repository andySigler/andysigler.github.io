Screen Racer is a multi-screen, online game, made with HTML5, Node.js, and WebSockets. Using the iPhone's orientation as a controller, players send their helicopter through rough terrain, all spread across any number of connected web browsers. This allows Screen Racer's landscape to depend on the physical placement of the screens. I have found it fun to place the screens in a circle, forcing the player to run in circles in order to keep up with their helicopter.
