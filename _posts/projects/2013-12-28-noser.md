Noser explores the real-time performance of timbre.

Traditional instrumentation has explored changes in pitch, level, rhythm and timing for thousands of years. With computers and music synthesis, we can now explore the manipulation of a sound's spectral shape and content through physical interaction.

This interface uses a multi-touch trackpad, proximity sensor, and flexible polycarbonite poles, all to allow the human hand to expressively perform vowel sounds. The fingers horizontal position moves the frequency of resonant bandpass filters, while their vertical position alters the filters' Q.

Below is an earlier prototype of the system.
