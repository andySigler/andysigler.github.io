Foodable is an interactive table, designed for a NYC food event, and made in collaboration with <a href="https://johncapogna.com/" target="blank">John Capogna</a> and <a href="https://shilpanbhagat.com/site/" target="_blank">Shilpan Bhagat</a>. Using multiple sensing technologies, we allow diners to â€œplayâ€ with their food, while simultaneously learning about their dish and drink.
