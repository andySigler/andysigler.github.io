The **uarm-python-wrapper** [see on GitHub](https://github.com/andysigler/uarm-python-wrapper) is a fork and wrapper/extension of the [uArm-Python-SDK](https://github.com/uArm-Developer/uArm-Python-SDK) from uFactory. The goal of this fork is to create a more intuitive and easier to use set of controls for the [uArm Swift/SwiftPro](https://store.ufactory.cc/products/uarm), built on-top of the original Python API from uFactory.

All code was developed as a part of a fellowship at NYU's ITP program, from February to May 2020.

Demo projects were made using the uArm Swift Pro, to have fun and explore the arm's functionality.
