teaser: I made a panel of 10 Arduino Pro Mini clones I designed. Their design was constrained by my DIY process, and the boards turned out great with the new soldermask process.

Here are some pictures of my attempt at making a panel of 10 Arduino Mini's of my own design. You can find the pin layout, board files, and other documentation on [GitHub]({{ site.github }}/homemade-hardware/tree/master/Arduino-SMD);

I've been working on this board design for a while, trying to make the board small and simple, yet having to consider the limitations of making my own PCBs in house (namely, vias being so difficult to make).

These 10 boards were created within one day at ITP. I milled the panel in the morning, cleaned and added solder mask in the afternoon, and assembled at night. It was a long process, but I've never been able to make 10 boards of such quality and in such a short amount of time.
