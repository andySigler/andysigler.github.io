Homemade Hardware ([link to class website](https://www.homemadehardware.com)) is a graduate course tought at [NYU's ITP program](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) starting in 2015. There, student learn to design and fabricate DIY PCBs, all without leaving the school.

To make a working PCB for a physical computing project, a variety of new skills must be learned relatively quickly in a semester. From electronics basics, to CAD design, and milling machines.

Designing and fabricating PCBs rapidly can be difficult, but there are some great advantages for students at ITP. These include quickly iterating designs while learning this new medium (no long lead-times), and exploring the aesthetic of DIY electronics.
