The radio is a great solution for making a DIY mesh network, especially since an [Arduino library's](https://github.com/LowPowerLab/RFM69) already been written and well tested. I used their predecessor, the RFm12b, for my master's thesis, and this semester Benedetta Piantella's [Networked Sensor for Development](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/nsfd/) class needs 20 of them.

This post also shows some of my early <ed>experiences</ed> failures with the Dynamask solder mask. I followed [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0Syj4awcc8) on preparing the materials and applying the film.
