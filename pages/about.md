Hello, I'm Andy, and I want to experience the physical world as if it were a musical instrument; made to be touched, remixed, and to help us extend beyond the limitations of our bodies. A highly connected world is a canvas for our actions, and as artists and makers, we have the responsibility to grow an internet of things that enables creativity, improvisation, and open-source.

I am currently a research resident at [ITP-NYU](http://itp.nyu.edu), where I focus on physical computing, PCB fabrication, and connected devices. My past experiences include lead-developer and interaction designer at OpenTrons, and creative-developer at BitTorrent.

This Fall I will teach a class at ITP titled Homemade Hardware, where I will be showing artists and designers how to fabricate custom circuit boards for microcontroller-based projects (syllabus and tutorials coming soon).
