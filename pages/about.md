I am currently a research resident at [ITP-NYU](http://itp.nyu.edu), where I focus on physical computing, PCB fabrication, and connected devices. I will be teaching a course at ITP this Fall titled [Homemade Hardware](http://homemadehardware.com), where I will be showing students how to fabricate custom circuit boards for microcontroller-based projects.

My past experiences include lead-developer and interaction designer at OpenTrons, and creative-developer at BitTorrent.

I believe a highly connected world is a canvas for our actions. As artists and makers, we have the responsibility to grow an internet of things that enables creativity, improvisation, and open-source. I want to know how we can make a networked world that operates on our own terms.
