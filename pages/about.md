![me]({{ site.url }}/images/me_small.jpg "me")

I'm interested in networked and interactive objects. I want to encourage [improvisation and play]({{ site.url }}/itp/how-to-make-the-internet-of-useless-things) in the Internet of Things, and I hope to someday fill my home with networked musical instruments and toys.

I am currently a research resident at the [Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)](https://itp.nyu.edu) at NYU, where I focus on PCB rapid prototyping and connected devices. I will be teaching a course entitled Homemade Hardware at ITP beginning Fall '15. Previously I was lead developer and interaction designer at [OpenTrons](http://opentrons.com).

# Background

Originally a guitar player, I graduated from Hamilton College '10 with a degree in politics, but worked as an audio engineer and instructor after graduation. My interests quickly shifted towards new musical interfaces and interactive technologies, and I enrolled in ITP to explore these fields.
