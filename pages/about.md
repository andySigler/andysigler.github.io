<h1><span class="avoidMe">About</span></h1>
<p class="avoidMe thingy">
    Andy is a designer who uses software and electronics to design novel experiences, interactions, and devices. Emerging technologies bring hightened connectivity and autonomy to the objects around us, and Andy hopes to use these tools to bring magic to everyday objects. We need a little less sci-fi, and a little more magic wands and talking candlesticks.
</p>
<p class="avoidMe thingy">
    Beginning at the <a href="http://tisch.nyu.edu/itp">Interactive Telecommunications Program</a> (ITP) at NYU, Andy became immersed in the world of wireless hardware and interaction design. He brought these insights to his roles as Research Resident and Adjunct Professor at ITP, as well as Electronics-Design Engineer at the IoT Design Firm in NYC, <a href="http://www.tomorrow-lab.com">Tomorrow Lab</a>.
</p>
<p class="avoidMe thingy">
    For the past few years, Andy has designed and shipped an open-source liquid-handling platform at <a href="http://www.opentrons.com">Opentrons Labworks</a>. There, Andy gained experience in production software, product design, electronics engineering, research and development, as well as hardware manufacturing while helping build up Opentrons' factory in Shenzhen, China. This was rewarding work, as Opentrons' product line and mission are truly helping the world's scientists gain access to the 21st century's design and automation tools, helping them to solve life's biggest problems.

<p class="avoidMe thingy">
    These days, Andy is interested in the intersection of machine-learning, hardware, and interaction design. What new experiences can we design if our devices learn from us?
